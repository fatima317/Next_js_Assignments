    content: `AI development is evolving at a quick pace, and recently we were introduced to the revolution in this transformative technology: large language models. But beyond the mere novelty, LLMs possess the potential to revolutionize the way businesses operate. Partnering with seasoned AI developers like Agente, the organizations can tackle industry-specific challenges and unlock new avenues for growth. That is because, trained on vast troves of text data, LLMs exhibit an uncanny ability to mimic and manipulate human language in unprecedented ways. 

This article serves as your comprehensive guide to navigating the world of LLMs. We will delve into the technical underpinnings of these models, demystifying their types, capabilities, and limitations.

Basic concept of LLMs
Before we kick off, let’s answer the most basic question — what is a large language model?

At the heart of every LLM lies a sophisticated algorithm known as a neural network. Imagine this network as a sprawling metropolis, bustling with interconnected artificial neurons. Each neuron, like a dedicated citizen, processes and transmits information to its neighbors, constantly collaborating to decipher the patterns within the text data.

As the LLM processes this data, it meticulously studies the relationships between words, sentences, and entire documents. It learns to recognize how language is used to communicate concepts.

And just like the city evolves its infrastructure over time, the LLM's neural network refines its connections and builds an intricate internal map of the language. This map allows the LLM to perform the following functions:

Language generation: similar to a skilled storyteller, the LLM can create narratives and generate different creative text formats, like poems, code, scripts, musical pieces, email, letters, etc., all by drawing upon the patterns it has picked up from its training data;
Language understanding: the LLM also analyzes text, extracting key information, identifying sentiment, and comprehending the nuances of human expression. This ability allows it to perform tasks like summarizing documents, answering questions, and even engaging in natural conversations;
Language adaptation: the LLM is a dynamic entity that is constantly learning and adapting. It can fine-tune its internal language map based on new encounters with text, allowing it to specialize in specific domains or even adjust its communication style to different audiences;

Thanks to these characteristics LLMs can tackle complex business challenges and unlock new growth opportunities. In the next section, we'll explore how LLMs are reshaping the business fields.

How does a large language model work technically?
As we have discussed before, the power of LLMs stems from a computational engine known as a neural network. Inspired by the structure of the human brain, these networks work like webs of interconnected nodes, mimicking the way neurons communicate and collaborate. Each node receives information from its neighbors, processes it through a weighted function, and sends its own output signal along. This collective dance of data processing allows the network to learn complex patterns and relationships within the information it receives.

But LLMs don't simply emerge from thin air. The developers train an AI model through a rigorous process. With each piece of information, the LLM's neural network adjusts its internal connections. It compares its predictions to the desired outputs, learning from its mistakes and gradually refining its understanding of language.

Within this training regime, different types of neural network architectures play crucial roles. One prominent architecture is the Transformer, which revolutionized LLMs' ability to comprehend and generate language. Transformers excel at analyzing the relationships between words within a sentence, even those at a distance, capturing the true essence of meaning and context. This allows LLMs to go beyond simple word-by-word predictions, instead generating coherent and grammatically correct text, and even understanding the sentiment and intention behind it.

The sheer scale of training data and the sophistication of neural network architectures empower LLMs to achieve an almost human-like level of language understanding. Now, let’s delve deeper into the practical applications of LLMs, and see how they put that understanding to practice.

  "What is an Online Patient Portal and Why Your Clinic Needs One?": {
    title: "An Online Patient Portal and Why Your Clinic Needs One?",
    image: "/thumb_Patient_portal_app.png",
    content: `Technologies have transformed the healthcare sector in numerous ways, but mainly through digital innovations. And it’s not only about new devices and enhancing medical practices with faster drug research and production, but also in the industry of personal healthcare. In particular, patient portal development can significantly improve relationships between doctors and patients. 

According to Verified Market Research, the global patient portal market is expected to skyrocket from USD 1.94 billion in 2018 to USD 7.34 billion by 2026.

After the COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for online patient portals increased significantly. 

Agente decided to take a closer look at this phenomenon according to its experience and talk more about online patient portal software development, its benefits, features, and challenges.

What is an online patient portal and how does it help?
An online patient portal is a secure online website that gives patients convenient, fast, 24-hour access to personal health information from anywhere with an Internet connection. Those apps collect a lot of data that is being analyzed by AI and big data analytic tools, which allows them to provide personalized treatment and care for patients. 

According to the World Health Organization, chronic diseases have been projected to account for almost three-quarters of all deaths worldwide in 2020. A study by Kaiser Permanente revealed that online patient portals alone can improve preventive and chronic disease management by nearly 10% for some conditions. 

Other studies confirm that these types of healthcare IT tools generate patient loyalty and increase patient satisfaction and engagement.

What are the benefits of an online patient portal?
Patient engagement and satisfaction continue to emerge as a growing theme in healthcare since the advent of value-based care. Here is what makes an online patient portal app great for both patients and providers. 

Better patient communication
The portal allows patients to accomplish tasks that would normally require long phone conversations. Patients can share important information, such as clinical summaries or educational materials, and request appointments, referrals, and prescription refills. It increases the efficiency of clinical staff, allowing them to focus on the patients who have the most urgent care needs and questions.

Streamlined patient registration and administrative tasks 
With patient portals, people complete registration forms electronically before appointment check-in, which keeps front-office work efficient. Now, the front office staff can focus on the patient in front of them. It ensures that by the time the patient reaches your clinic, they feel comfortable with the administrative side of things. The only remaining questions are medical.

Greater focus on patient care
Physicians are less distracted since they can access and share patient information electronically. They don’t need to page through the patient’s chart to find the information needed.  Instead, they can focus solely on providing a higher standard of care.

Improved clinical outcomes
Since patients get a more convenient way to perform such tasks as requesting repeat prescriptions and referrals or booking an appointment, they become more compliant. When patients follow doctors’ orders, clinical outcomes improve.

In 2019, the Journal of Medical Internet Research published a study of patient portals and how they facilitated the work of healthcare providers. According to 58 articles on patient portals reviewed in the study, the systems enabled the easier discovery of medical errors, improved adherence to medications and overall patient engagement, and streamlined patient-provider communication.

Optimized medical office workflow
Giving patients online access frees medical staff from writing down prescription requirements, scheduling appointments, reporting on lab results, and taking messages for physicians. 

Patients increase engagement in and ownership of their health. If a patient has a chronic condition that impairs their ability to visit the surgery in person, the online portal is the place to discuss issues and answer questions. It increases the patient's ability to engage in their care. 

24/7 access to EHR
An online patient portal app gives unlimited access to logically arranged patients’ health records. What’s more, medical staff can effectively track any changes in them and update the treatment course.

Challenges
Even if healthcare providers offer patient portal access, that doesn’t mean all patients access their health information. Online patient portals may be lagging behind consumer desires for digital engagement. Below are the major challenges that patient portals face, which prevent them from becoming a comprehensive hub in which people can engage in their care.

Patients are reluctant to adopt these systems
Healthcare providers might be aware of the health perks of using a patient portal. Yet, patients are seldom as excited about the portal as the providers are. Portals are sometimes viewed negatively because providers struggle to establish the notion of their obligatory use. While using the portal, patients get frustrated by the confusing interface of the app. Often they just don’t know how to use the system, receive a response to a query, or upload images for doctors to see. Patients are regularly overwhelmed with automated emails and clinical notes with medical jargon.

Here are the tips to encourage patients to adopt the online patient portal:

Register patients in the office. Before or after the appointment office staff can help to sign up and demonstrate how to navigate. 
Advertise the portal. Hand out flyers or informational brochures to patients explaining how the portal will help patients and how to sign up. Display promotion posters throughout the office.
Encourage and educate patients to use the porta during visits. Patients trust their providers and can be persuaded in person. 
Share exclusive clinical data. For example, share lab results only via an online patient portal. 
Ask for feedback. Ask patients about their portal experience, and what they particularly like or dislike, so that you can change or add some features. 
Healthcare data security concerns
Healthcare organizations that decide to build their own applications must adhere to strict security regulations stated in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). This aims to keep personally identifiable information (PII) and health information (PHI) safe and secure.

Another data concern is that healthcare organizations have to ensure interoperability. This means the patient portal or any health tool must be able to interact with other systems for faster and more transparent data exchange.

Due to the scarcity of internal IT resources and the wish to comply with security regulations, many healthcare organizations use third-party vendors to build their online patient portals. However, you should be aware that if a vendor commits violations, you won’t be exempt from penalties. Healthcare providers should sign a HIPAA Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with their vendors to allay compliance concerns.

Online patient portal features
To make an online patient portal useful for both patients and healthcare providers, consider including the following features:

For patients
Patient registration – to create a profile and input all necessary information through a tablet or computer.

Custom vs off-the-shelf healthcare IT apps
There’s always a temptation to buy a ready-made solution to save time and money. However, the desired result may not be achieved. Out-of-the-box patient portals may not be the best fit for your organization, especially if you are a small-town practice.

Ready-made healthcare apps often contain a lot of features you don’t need and lack the ones you do need.  This can result in incompatibility with your current workflows, which confuses both employees and patients who won’t use the system whatsoever. 

Only a custom-built solution addresses all the needs of your organization. If an off-the-shelf solution is not customized to a particular healthcare system, the system needs to adjust itself to recurring solution updates. It’s not convenient and also costs money.

It is worth mentioning that ready-made solutions are often bought on a subscription basis, which will eventually cost several times more than a custom platform. 

Examples
Take a look at the examples of the best healthcare website designs, namely online patient portals. General practitioners and primary care providers can set up an account in the patient portal to offer their patients secure online communications. The portals support such features as:

Online booking
Secure Messaging
Resource sharing
Video consultation software (in-app or via text or e-mail)
Form completion to assist in triaging
Payment functionalities (e-invoicing, payment on the video screen, etc.)
E-prescriptions (coming soon)`,

    content: `In an era marked by rapid technological advancements and a growing emphasis on healthcare accessibility, the role of telehealth app development has never been more pivotal. 

The remote provision of clinical care―telehealth―started to gain traction in March 2020 when the world became exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic. The offline healthcare institutions were overloaded. Patients were stricken up with confusion and the new reality.

Consequently, authorities were forced to adjust country-specific public health guidelines and introduce pandemic-related telehealth policy changes.

Based on the Agente team’s expertise in custom telehealth app development, let’s consider in depth how the introduction of telehealth functionality can benefit your healthcare institution, medical workers, and patients.

In this telemedicine app development guide, we share step-by-step guidelines on telehealth app development and must-have features to include in such a project.

Benefits of Telehealth App for Patients
Now, we know what has given telehealth such a boost and the reasons and new challenges behind it, so let’s consider how advantageous the technology is for all the healthcare system’s major participants. 

Benefits for Patients
Here, telemedicine brings the ability to deal with numerous healthcare gaps which, previously, were impossible to fill. Some of them include:

Better healthcare accessibility for remote areas. Some rural locations in many countries worldwide still don’t offer nearby medical services. For instance, according to a survey conducted by the Australian Institute of Healthcare and Welfare, three in five people say that one of the justifications for not seeing a doctor was not having one nearby.
Easier healthcare access for the elderly and disabled. Healthcare accessibility has always been acute for such patients. With the simultaneously arising question of technical literacy for elderly people, telemedicine brings such patients a chance to receive quality medical assistance from the comfort of their homes. It is especially critical at the time of the pandemic and reduces the chances of exposure to coronavirus at offline hospitals.
No waiting in line. Is there anyone who enjoys long waits? Telemedicine accommodates appointment scheduling with ease. No need to sit in traffic jams or stress out about being late. Your patients can quickly switch from their daily routine to get on a video call with their physician, for example.
Medical records overview. Many are Google-friendly and love studying their medical records just to get an overview or keep things under control. Moreover, it brings ease of medical data sharing with private physicians or even some family members.
Benefits for Physicians
A telemedicine platform brings the following benefits for healthcare specialists:

Ability to collaborate with medical centers. Multiple professionals strive to become independent or even self-employed. Healthcare professionals often seem to live at their work. Joining your telemedicine app could bring them more freedom and opportunities.
Real-time access to the patient's data. Telehealth solutions provide integration with EHRs, allowing medical specialists access to the required data from anywhere, and enabling them to keep track of the patient's indicators.
Better time management. Medical professionals are often overwhelmed with work. With a telehealth self-service app, they can better balance life and work activities. 
Benefits for Owners of Medical Institutions
Telehealth brings another set of advantages:

Reduced healthcare costs. Just as it reduces the cost of renting a working space, self-employed physicians can join the service.
Higher customer flow. The pace of life has become even busier. Customers hate to wait. Thus, offering quality on-the-go consultations could become your competitive advantage and thus generate more revenue.
Better personnel management and KPIs. Such software improves the effectiveness of the provided healthcare self-service, ensuring your workspace is a pleasant place to be at and distributing the doctors’ workload evenly.
Improved patients’ experience of care. The likelihood of the patients’ and their families’ engagement or self-service in healthcare outcomes is critical for any business. Convenience, follow-up messages, and flexibility bring top-level experiences.
Key Features of Telehealth App Development
Telehealth apps have become increasingly popular in recent years. These apps offer a convenient and accessible way for individuals to receive medical care and advice from the comfort of their own homes. The following are the must-have features of telehealth apps:

Ability to schedule appointments easily. This feature allows users to book a session with a healthcare professional at a time that works best for them, eliminating the need to wait in long queues or take time off work. 
Secure messaging and video conferencing capabilities for virtual doctor visits, allowing patients to communicate with their healthcare providers, ask questions, and receive updates on their treatment plans.
Electronic health records (EHRs) integration for easy retrieval of patient data by providers and other healthcare professionals involved in care delivery.
By providing these essential features within an intuitive user interface tailored to each customer’s needs and preferences, telehealth apps can significantly improve overall customer experience and reduce costs associated with traditional healthcare services.

Telehealth Software Development: How to Make Your Project Compliant?
Before plunging into mHealth software development, make sure to get acquainted with the corresponding regulations and legal requirements. Otherwise, ensure that your telehealth product development partner is acutely aware of the compliance requirements for your project:

Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
This United States federal statute provides security and privacy provisions to safeguard medical records.

As real-time video conferencing in telehealth is the best means of communicating with patients, the application of such technology involves personal healthcare data sharing and exchange.

HIPAA requires healthcare providers to ensure and maintain the security of electronically protected healthcare information (ePHI). Violation of the HIPAA requirements is punishable with a $250,000 fine.

For secure telehealth platform development, to be HIPAA compliant, you must offer:

Strong entity or user authentication
Enforced access controls
ePHI integrity and end-to-end encryption
Granular audit
Secure data transmission
IEC 62304
This international standard defines the lifecycle requirements for medical software development. Compliance with the standard’s regulations applies to both the United States and European Union.

Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)
Being a nonprofit foundation, OWASP operates to ensure high software security. It includes weak passwords, outdated software and components, and more.

“You’re dealing with the vendor and the platform, you’re dealing with the provider’s environment, and you’re also dealing with the patient environment. So pretty much anything that you look at as far as a risk or vulnerability, you have to triple [the risk] because those threats and vulnerabilities exist in three interconnected arenas.”
George Jackson Jr., Senior Principal Consultant at healthcare cyber-risk management firm Clearwater
FDA 21 CFR Part 820
Also known as the Quality System Regulation (QSR), these regulations ensure that medical devices are both safe and effective.

At Agente, we have proven experience in rendering telemedicine website development services in full compliance with HIPAA, IEC 62304, OWASP, and FDA 21 CFR (Part 820) requirements.

Step-by-Step Guidelines on Telemedicine App Development
If you wonder how to build a telehealth application, we recommend these six steps:

Step #1. Business Requirements Analysis
In the process of sharing the business ideas and goals for your future telehealth project, its technical feasibility and estimations will take place at this step.

Your telemedicine app developers must have a clear idea about the possible telemedicine monetization options to flawlessly iterate them in the project.

Conclusion
Creating a telehealth app is an exciting opportunity to bring healthcare services directly to patients. Prior to beginning, you must specify the features and goals of your app, such as whether it will be utilized for remote consultations or appointment scheduling. Once these details are defined, you can begin creating the user interface and experience. For your app to adhere to industry standards, you'll also need to think about how data will be maintained securely and any applicable legislation. Lastly, before releasing your product, develop a thorough testing strategy to ensure that users have a flawless experience with few technical problems.`,

    content: `As an owner of an educational platform, you might face several exciting challenges related to the design of your educational website.

One of the major issues could be creating a user-friendly and visually appealing educational website design that captures the attention of your target audience. A well-designed education website should not only showcase the institution's mission and values but also provide easy access to relevant information for students, parents, and educators.
Another challenge could be optimizing your website for different devices and screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience for users on both desktop and mobile platforms.

It is crucial to address these design issues to create a successful educational platform that attracts and retains users..

Based on the experience of the Agente team which provides LMS website design services, we are happy to share our knowledge on how to design for a revenue-generating educational website and provide you with the best examples.

Things to Consider in Educational Website Design
1. Set Up Your Goals
Education website design development starts like any other design.
You set up your business objective, define the target audience, and customize the website to achieve your goals.

For example, if you plan to create a website design for educational institutions, you should address both pupils and their parents, who will visit the site.

You’ll need to balance bold and colorful elements with informative content and easy navigation in order to appeal to both target groups.

2. Elaborate on Visuals
Remember our insights about color palettes for educational website design
in one of our blog posts?

And the education industry is no exception.

If you have a brand book for your educational institution, make sure your website colors match the existing scheme to create a homogeneous brand image.

For an e-learning platform, use neutral and convincing colors, for example blue, green, brown. 

Highlight essential edtech design elements, such as headers, footers, CTA buttons with other hues matching the color palette.

3. Add Content and Media Elements
The well-structured, consistent, and meaningful copy is half the battle.

Here’s why: a website that combines useful content, and user-friendly elements of web design, will foster trusted long-term relationships with more students.

Media elements make the education website more attractive and the learning process more interactive.

4. Get Some Inspiration
Well, it’s not really the next step when thinking about education website development; inspiration is something that should follow you the whole way through.

However, best educational website design for physical institutions and online learning platforms will differ in their form and content.

Let’s overview the best educational website design features for each of the educational website types.

Features of Educational Website Design for University & School
Developing a good website design for educational institutions should attract new students and orient existing students.

The following education website ideas and features will ensure your site gets a better conversion rate and more visitors who will stay longer:
University or school hierarch
Show how the faculties, courses, or subjects are arranged. Present the heads of departments, deans, and teachers. Make the site searchable across sections and publications.
Online timetable
Timetable functionality goes without saying. However, some EdTech website designs and features are often overlooked. For example, for security, make the timetable available only after the student/teacher logs in. If the university has several buildings or departments across the city, it’s great to pin the studying locations to the map and provide directions.
Applicant info
Applicants are a vital part of the target audience. Make sure to add some key dates of application and enrollment, including all relevant information. Let the visitors subscribe to notifications about the enrollment flow.
Live chat
A live chat option throughout the website improves the user experience and helps you to generate leads. Voice interaction or chatbots are gaining more trust among millennial and generation Z users, so consider this option when defining the target audience.
Virtual tour
Videos, photos, panoramas, or 3D tours will add to the student engagement and impress potential students, even before they step inside the campus.
Video
If you want to go further in showing how amazing life inside your university is, shoot some videos around the campus with the help of drones. Then put the videos into the background of some banners, or create a separate section where potential students can watch them. Not only will it show how things are inside your institution, but it will also build trust and add to credibility.
Customer-oriented CTAs
A direct and clear call to action and application form will show what the institute wants its target visitors to do—apply, take a virtual tour, or subscribe to a newsletter. Many institutions pay no regard to these features, so you have a real chance to stand out.
Gamification
According to the Emerald research, well-designed gamification elements are well-received by about 85% of students. What is more, gamification elements should not be limited to a video game-like experience but should foster the relatedness and anatomy of the learning process, and ensure better learning outcomes.

As a result, gamification, as an element of education web design, should be contextual and relevant to the user. Four types of players should be considered: killers (20%), achievers (40%), socializers (80%), and explorers (50%) (according to Richard Bartle, who studied gamers). Then, they should be combined with the learner types you have.

This will help choose the most appropriate for your project gamification mechanics:
Scores
Levels
Leaderboards
Unlocks
Progress bars
Course currency
Ranks
Badges and trophies
Upgraded avatars

For example, group competition that requires teamwork to complete a task can give the team extra internal currency, reward points, a real-life trophy, etc. Your imagination has no limits.`,
